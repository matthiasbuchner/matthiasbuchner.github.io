- Show up at the right place and right time :D
- It is free.
- Make sure you bring everything you need. Check the [Gear Up](/gear-up/) page for more info.
- There won't be any aid-station but we planned the route with stops at places where we ***should*** be able to refill with drinks and/or food every few hours.
- This is not a race, ideally we will walk as a group.
- If you decide to join, it is at your own risk. 
- The route is not marked, you will have to orientate yourself. A GPS Watch with map is highly recommended.
- Some of us plan to hike 100 km or 24 hours, which ever comes first. But you are welcome to join for ***just*** 25 km or 50 km!
- We have a Whatsapp group where you can get the latest updates and ask questions.

***What ifs***
- If you need to drop the group and go home, you can walk to the nearest train station or take a taxi to the station or home.
- The walk is rain or shine. If the weather is bad and decide to leave the group, you will have to find your way home.
- If there thunder lightening, we will cancel and we will all go home or to a safe place.
- We planned the route on Strava and Komoot. It is possible the path will not accessible or usable. In this case, weâ€™ll find a way around.
- There is no hotel or camping planned along the route. We are planning on sleeping on the trail.
- If your legs are sore... well that that's not a if, they will be for sure!
